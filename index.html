    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Sales Advisor - Currys</h3></li>
        <p>October 2022 - Current</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer support, handling and booking 40+ product issues a week as an instore team, liaising promptly with the appropriate repairs and installation teams, informing customers if adjustments to billing is required and ensuring high standards of customer experience are met.</li>
            <li>Generated 50+ repeat customers, through deep product knowledge gained in my free time and using a friendly tailored sales approach. My Average repeat customer spends £650+ every 3 to 9 months.</li>
            <li>I have achieved 35+ outstanding (ranked 9 or 10 out of 10) reviews within the last 4+ months. These have been given based on my customer service, knowledge on products and extra services we provide alongside products.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h3>Receptionist - Hotel Xanadu</h3></li>
        <p>March 2022 - August 2022</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delivered exceptional customer service while managing multiple large and complex group bookings in a fast-paced environment. Most notably, coordinated a 60-guest booking for a wedding situated close by the Hotel, ensuring each guest's room included the specified amenities to meet requirements.</li>
            <li>Built a rapport with 15+ regular guests who booked through third party apps, learning their room preferences, providing extra of their favourite amenities. This initiative led these customers to eventually take my offer of a competitive price with the assurance that service and their preferences would always be top priority where possible. On average, this increased profit margins on these bookings by 10+% as this cut out commission towards third party apps.</li>
            <li>Assisted the new manager and new receptionist when they first started, training them on Hotel Xanadu’s property management software, sharing all relevant knowledge and best practices I had acquired.</li>
